@elizaos/plugin-goat
A plugin for integrating blockchain capabilities through the GOAT (Great Onchain Agent Toolkit) framework within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

Description
GOAT üêê (Great Onchain Agent Toolkit) is an open-source framework for adding blockchain tools such as wallets, being able to hold or trade tokens, or interacting with blockchain smart contracts, to your AI agent.

Chains supported
Plugins supported
This plugin integrates GOAT with Eliza, giving your agent the ability to interact with many different protocols. The current setup adds onchain capabilities to your agent to send and check balances of ETH and USDC, and to swap tokens using KIM protocol. Add all the capabilities you need by adding more plugins (read below for more information)!

Installation
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-goat
Configuration
Environment Variables
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=<Your EVM wallet private key>
EVM_PROVIDER_URL=<Your RPC provider URL (e.g., Infura, Alchemy)>
Configure GOAT for your use case
Configure the chain you want to use by updating the wallet.ts file (see all available chains at https://ohmygoat.dev/chains)
Specify the actions you want to have by updating the actions.ts file
Add the plugins you need to perform these actions to the getOnChainTools function (uniswap, polymarket, etc. see all available plugins at https://ohmygoat.dev/chains-wallets-plugins)
Build the project running pnpm build
Add the necessary environment variables to set up your wallet and plugins
Run your agent!
Common Issues
Agent not executing an action:
If you are also using the EVM Plugin, sometimes the agent might confuse the action name with an EVM Plugin action name instead of the GOAT Plugin action. Removing the EVM Plugin should fix this issue. There is no need for you to use both plugins at the same time.
If you are using Trump as a character it might be tricky to get them to perform any action since the character is full of prompts that aim to change the topic of the conversation. To fix this try using a different character or create your own with prompts that are more suitable to what the agent is supposed to do.
Plugins
GOAT itself has several plugins for interacting with different protocols such as Polymarket, Uniswap, and many more. (see all available plugins at https://ohmygoat.dev/chains-wallets-plugins)

You can easily add them by installing them and adding them to the getOnChainActions function:

const tools = getOnChainActions({
    wallet: walletClient,
    plugins: [
        sendETH(),
        erc20({ tokens: [USDC, PEPE] }),
        polymarket(),
        uniswap(),
        // ...
    ],
});
